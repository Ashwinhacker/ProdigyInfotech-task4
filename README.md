# keylogger

This Python script serves as a basic keylogger with email functionality, designed for ethical purposes only. It employs the `keyboard` module to capture keystrokes and stores them in a log file along with timestamps. The script also utilizes the `smtplib` library to send the logged keystrokes via email. Users need to configure the sender and receiver email addresses along with the sender's password for authentication. Upon execution, the keylogger continuously monitors keyboard events until interrupted by the user. Once stopped, it sends the recorded keystrokes as an email attachment to the specified recipient. While the code demonstrates a simple implementation of a keylogger for educational or legitimate purposes such as parental control or employee monitoring with explicit consent, it's crucial to emphasize the ethical considerations and legal implications surrounding the use of such tools. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can infringe upon individuals' privacy rights and may violate laws governing surveillance and data protection. Therefore, users must ensure compliance with applicable regulations and obtain consent before deploying keylogging software.
